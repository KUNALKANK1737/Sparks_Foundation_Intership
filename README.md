## TASK : Prediction usin Unsupervised ML
### TASK 1 : Problem Statement: Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

### Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook) 
### Dataset used: http://bit.ly/w-data
## Brief : In this task of predicting the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours we are fistly collecting the data from the data set and then we are understanding the data , also ones the data is totally undersood . We are creting the regression on the basis of the data which we have got . Then after that we are checking the model fitting and then the last step is to apply the model for prediciton .

### Task 2 Problem Statement: From the Given Iris Dataset , Predicting the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

### Tool Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook) 
### Dataset used: http://bit.ly/3kXTox
## Brief : In the task of the prediction of the number of clusters using the iris dataset  , we are going to firstly load the iris dataset . Then we are going to find the number of the clustering and then as we are going to use the "Elbow Method" here for representation of the clustering of the data.After the Elbow Menthod we are going to classify the dataset by kmeans . The last step is to visualize the clusters .
